However, in case you have an account, you would perceive that it becomes much more convenient and enjoyable!</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1 c14">When I click on &lsquo;Select Gift&rsquo; or &lsquo;Group Gift this item&rsquo; am I purchasing the item?</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1">No, you are only indicating that you are considering this item for Group-gifting and it would get added to your cart. The payment process comes after you have chosen your list of friends for the group. </span></p><span class="c17 c14 c21">&nbsp;</span><p class="c9"><span class="c8 c14">Does setting up a group gift cost money?</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c8">Not at all! Setting up a gift group is a totally free process. The only payment you make is the share that you put in from your part.</span></p><p class="c9 c18"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1 c14">What if the occasion I am gifting for is not among the &ldquo;Choose the Occasion&rdquo; options?</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1">No worries! We have an option - &lsquo;Just felt like gifting&rsquo; in the list only for you.</span></p>
<p class="c4"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1 c14">Can I decide the amount that each friend needs to pay differently?</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1">Yes, we have that provision quite handy. Just select &lsquo;Split unequally&rsquo; from the drop down list above the list of friends in step 2 of the gifting process. After that, you can enter the amount desired in the fields differently but the total should remain equal to the price of the gift.  </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c22"><span class="c8"></span><span class="c8 c14">Is the &ldquo;message to invitees&rdquo; that has been provided by default the only message I can use?</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c8 c20">No! This message is just a suggested default. We strongly encourage you to change it to say whatever you like!</span></p><p class="c7 c10"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c8 c14">Do contributors have to pay the amount I have allocated to them?</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c8">Yes, if you split the amount equally or allocate the money to be chipped in to them, they have to pay the amount you allocate. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c8 c14">How will I know that the invites have gone out to invitees?</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c8">You will get a confirmation mail informing you of the invitees to whom you have sent an invite</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c8"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c8 c14">Can I invite more people later or is this my only chance to invite people?</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c8">Absolutely! You can invite more friends at a later stage to contribute to the group gift as well. More friends means more fun and more love shared!</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c8"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1 c14">Can the invited people invite more of their friends/colleagues?</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1">Yes. If you wish to give your invitees the permission to invite more people, you can indicate that via a checkbox on page2 of the process of group gifting. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c8"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c8 c19">Managing the group-gift event</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1 c14">Is the deadline flexible?</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1">Though we would like you to achieve the target of contribution from the members of the group by the requisite date, yet we shall give you the option later to extend it</span><span class="c1 c15 c14">&nbsp;once</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;by a certain number of days in case the money falls short by the first deadline. For editing, you (gift organizer) can click on the 'calendar' icon near the current deadline on your tracker page to choose the new date for achieving the contribution. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c8"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1 c14">When can I put in my contribution?</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1">Oh, right away! After verifying all the details in step 3 of the gifting process, you can click on the button &lsquo;Contribute my share&rsquo; at the bottom right corner that will take you forward through the payment gateway for completing the transaction. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c8 c14">How will I know if someone has chipped in for the group gift?</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c8">You get an email notification when a contributor pays in his/her amount.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c8">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c22"><span class="c8 c14">Do the amounts that I&rsquo;ve asked my friends to contribute change if I add another friend to the gift after I sent out the original invites?</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c8 c20">It depends on the way you chose to allocate the gift cost. If you chose to split the gift evenly, we will automatically readjust how much each person is supposed to contribute. In this case, if a friend has already given his/her share, then the remaining amount will be split equally among friends who are yet to put in money. When a friend comes to the website to pay, he will be able to see the change besides we will be reminding him about the change via e-mail as well. If you chose to enter contribution amounts manually, we will follow your amounts. </span></p><p class="c6 c18"><span class="c8"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1 c14">What happens if the total contribution falls short of the price and the deadline is approaching?</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1">Well, firstly we will remind you by mail about the approaching deadline so you don&rsquo;t need to worry about forgetting the date at any time. Also, in the initial mail as well as in the reminder mail, the link for 'tracker' page would be embedded that will help you out to still carry on the desired gift for the recipient for that special occasion! These options are - </span></p><p class="c12 c23"><span class="c2">- </span><span class="c1">Purchase now, collect later </span></p><p class="c12 c23"><span class="c27 c15">Allows you to put in the remaining amount for the group from your account so that you can be rest assured that the gift is received by the intended recipient. </span></p><br /><p class="c12 c23"><span class="c11">- </span><span class="c11 c24">Message your friends</span></p><p class="c12 c23"><span class="c11 c15">Allows you to send important reminders via mails or facebook messages to your friends in the group. </span></p><br /><p class="c12 c23"><span class="c11">- </span><span class="c11 c24">Invite more friends</span></p><p class="c12 c23"><span class="c11 c15">Allows you to add more friends (either via mail or facebook) to the whole group so that there are more sharing hands and you can attain the target with ease!</span></p><br /><span class="c11 c15"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c8 c14">How do I track the progress of the group gift?</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c8">You can track the progress of the group gift and make necessary changes to the event on your tracker page, the link of which will be sent to your E-mail address. </span></p><p class="c7 c12"><span class="c11 c15"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1 c14">Is there an option to cancel the gift event?</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1">As much as we would love to see you complete the process for the amazing gift that you chose, still we acknowledge that sometimes, the final gift just doesn&rsquo;t get the share due to some unavoidable circumstances. Hence, we have the cancellation option as well, which would be mentioned in the &lsquo;step 3&rsquo; of the process as well as the mail that we send across!</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c8 c14">How will you use the information that I share with you on the widget?</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c8">The personal information shared by you, is used to suggest, create and organise a group gift event only.
